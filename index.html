<h1>Only In Dreams- Weezer</h1>  
<h2>Written by: Rivers Cuomo</h2>
<p>You can't resist her <br>
She's in your bones <br>
She's in your marrow <br>
And your ride home <br>
You can't avoid her <br>
She's in the air (in the air) <br>
In between molecules <br>
Of oxygen and carbon dioxide <br>
Only in dreams <br>
We see what it means <br>
Reach out our hands <br>
Hold on to hers <br>
But when we wake <br>
It's all been erased <br>
And so it seems <br>
Only in dreams <br>
You walk up to her <br>
Ask her to dance <br>
She says, "hey baby <br>
I just might take the chance" <br>
You say "it's a good thing <br>
That you float in the air <br>
That way there's no way <br>
I will crush your pretty toenails into a thousand pieces" <br>
Only in dreams <br>
We see what it means <br>
Reach out our hands <br>
Hold on to hers <br>
But when we wake <br>
It's all been erased <br>
And so it seems <br>
Only in dreams <br>
Only in dreams <br>
Only in dreams <br>
Only in dreams <br>
Only in dreams <br>
Only in dreams <br>
Only in dreams</p>
